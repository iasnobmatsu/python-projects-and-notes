###  **Correlations**
<hr>

- Number of correlations for $x$ number of variables: $\frac{x(x-1)}{2}$. i.e. 20 measures, $\frac{20(19)}{2}=190$ correlations.These are a lot of correlations, so we need to use factor analysis to cut them down.
-  $variance=\frac{\sum{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}}{N-1}$
-  $covariance=\frac{\sum{(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}}{N-1}$
-  $correlation=\frac{cov_{xy}}{\sqrt{var_x}\sqrt{var_y}}$

correlation matrix (1 on diagnals) is covariance matrix (varaince on diagnals) normalized, most times interchangable.

exception: when variances are meaningful, use covariance matrix

- longitudinal data, variance at different timepoints should not be the same, use covariance matrix
- multiple groups, different groups cannot have the same variance, use covariance matrix


###  **Types of Factor Analysis**
<hr>

![EFA vs CFA](https://maksimrudnev.com/istanbul2019/images/EFACFA.png)
-  **Exploratory**: Let the data speak to itself, loadings ($\lambda$) exist for all measures, but some are small. Suppose there are 6 measures and 2 factors, the loading matrix with (column-factor, row-measures): 
  
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\lambda & \lambda \\
\lambda & \lambda \\
\lambda & \lambda \\
\lambda & \lambda \\
\lambda & \lambda \\
\lambda & \lambda \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

-  **Confirmatory**:  verify the number of latent dimensions of the instrument (factors) and the pattern of itemâ€“factor relationships (loadings), restricted, some factor loadings ($\lambda$) are exactly 0.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\lambda & 0 \\
\lambda & 0 \\
\lambda & 0 \\
0 & \lambda \\
0 & \lambda \\
0 & \lambda \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$


#### **History of factor analysis**
<hr>

- factor analysis originated from intelligence tests.
- Use test to get measurement of intelligence (latent construct)
	- e.g. GPA - independent from students' relative performance or dependent?
	- is there one general intelligence or specific factors (g/s theory)
	- one negative affect construct vs several factors e.g. anxiety, depression etc.
- racism, some use factor analysis to show the superiority of some races
- a mathematical approach used poorly 
- what is CFA good for?
	- strong falsification: put theories on danger zones
	- 'I am wrong if this does not hold'


#### **factor analysis motivations**
<hr>

- finding the underlying psychometric structures
 - one negative affect construct vs several factors e.g. anxiety, depression etc.
- scale development: developing a score from the structures
 - e.g LIP, 20 items -> 18 items
- scoring methods: optimal score for a scale, deciding weights



#### **steps in factor analysis**
<hr>

- how to extract factors
  - principle component analysis
  - principle axis factoring
- how many factors are there
  - very important
- rotation
  - improve interpretability of solutions

#### **PCA vs EFA**
<hr>

1. let loading be 1.0 for each item, fix residual variance to 0
  - The underlying factors account for 100% of measurement
  - No measurement error
  - $\hat{\eta}$ is the mean of all items

2. Let loading be freely estimated from data, fix residual to 0
  - 5 items are differentially weighted
  - $\hat{\eta}$ is the composite
  - This is PCA
  - All variance is true

3. Let loading be freely estimated from data, but also estimate residuals freely
  - 5 items are differentially weighted
  - error is free
  - $\hat{\eta}$ is the composite
  - This is PAF/Exploratory factor analysis
  - Part of the variance is true, others is error
  - the variance explained by factros is called "common variance"
  - The other variance is "unique" variance
    - broken down to "specific variance" true to item but not associated with error, plus "error variance"

For 5 items

$\sigma^2$ of each item is 1.0

$\sigma^2_t$ of total items is 5.0

we need fewer than 5 factors for data reduction

orphan item: an item does not belong anywhere

#### **EFA process**
<hr>

Eigenvalues are generated for each factor, which corresponds to the proportion of variance. A factor with eigenvalue of 3 means the factor accounts for variance equavalent to 3 items. 

**Communality**: explained variance = $R^2_multiple$
- In factor analysis, communality is 1
  - all variance can be used

$$R=\begin{bmatrix}
1.0& \\
r & 1.0 \\
r & r & 1.0 \\
r & r  & r & 1.0 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$


1. $PC_1$= get a weighted composite of all items $=0.1y_1+0.9y_2+0.3y_3....$
  - eigenvalue is the variance of the composite.
2. $PC_2$ calculated same was as $PC_1$, but need to exclude variance of $PC_1$
3. $PC_3$ exclude varaince of $PC_1$, $PC_2$
4. ... follow until all variance is explained 
**Where do we stop? How to choose factors?**

- **Kaiser-Guttman Rule**: factors in general need to have eigenvalues larger than 1, so a vector represents more variance than 1 measured variables
- **Scree Plot**: A plot of eigenvalues, when the plot slope change, stop choosing factors.

#### **Factor Rotation**
<hr>

- "simple structure": items need to load large on one factor and small on other factors
  - large vs small loading are subjective
- rotation helps interpretability, but it will not change fit of the model
- **Orthogonal Rotation**: the factors have a 90 degree, thus orthogonal. $cos(\gamma)$ where gamma is angle between factors is the correlation between axis representing factors, when $\gamma$ is 0, $cos(\gamma)$ (correlation) is 0.
  - varimax is one type of orthogonal rotation sometimes referenced as part of the "little Jiffy" process which also includes using PCA and the Kaiser-Gutman rule. 
- **Oblique Rotation**: the factors do not retain a 90 degree angle between each other. There are correlation among factors. $\gamma$ (correlation) is not 0.
  - promax is one type of oblique rotation. 
- cross loading: loads across factors

#### **EFA in SAS**
<hr>

The `reorder` argument reorders factor loading matrices.

```sas
/* PCA with scree plot: nfactors set to 1 because we are not really going to do PCA on data, just using the scree plot to see how many factors are appropriate */;
proc factor data=[data_name] method=principal scree nfactors=1 simple corr; run;
/* PCA with 4 factors using varimax rotation - not an appropriate subsituted of EFA because it ignores factor unique variance and assumes orthogonal relations */;
proc factor data=[data_name] method=principal nfactors=4 rotate=varimax reorder; run;
/* EFA with 4 factors using promax rotation*/;
proc factor data=[data_name] method=ML priors=smc nfactors=4 rotate=promax reorder; run;

```

#### **EFA in Mplus**
<hr>

Plot2 in the plot statement specifies Mplus to generate a scree plot.
